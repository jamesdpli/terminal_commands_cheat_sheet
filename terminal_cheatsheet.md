# Useful Terminal Commands
 
 ### Terminals, also known as command lines or consoles, allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface.

 - `cd` allows you to change directory 
 - `cd ..` goes up a directory
 - `cd -` returns to the last directory you were in 
 - `mkdir` creates a directory with the name you specify, for example mkdir my_folder will create a foler called "my_folder"
 - `touch` creates a file with a specific name, for example touch my_file will create a file called "my_file"
 - `pwd` prints file path
 - `ls` lists the content of the current directory
 - `ls -a` lists all content including hidden files
 - `clear` clears the terminal, if you want to see what you have cleared you can scroll up
